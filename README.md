# Engineering Study Materials Repository 📚

Welcome to my GitHub repository, a curated collection of PDF books and study materials I used during my four years of engineering. This treasure trove covers a wide array of subjects, with a focus on **Computer Science Engineering**. The content is based on the curriculum suggested by **MAKAUT university**.

Hope it will serve as a valuable resource for students _across various engineering colleges of other universities also_ since few subjects are bound to be same👀.

## Contents

The repository is organized with folders corresponding to different subjects. Whether you're diving into algorithms, databases, or exploring the intricacies of software engineering, you'll find a wealth of knowledge to aid your academic journey.

## Contribution and Collaboration 🤝

I believe in the power of community collaboration and knowledge sharing. If you find these materials beneficial, consider giving the repository a ⭐ to show your appreciation. Feel free to share this repository far and wide, helping more students access quality study materials.

## Future Plans 🚀

As time and internet speed permit, I plan to create a dedicated repository focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and coding-related materials. Additionally, I may add personal notes to further assist learners on their academic journey.
